**My Projects (Most Recent First)**
- **Unisys Wiki (SwiftUI)**
This is a private project, cannot be found on GitHub. This is my dissetation for my university final project. The purpose of this project is to create a cross-platform iOS app that will provide new hires and apprentices with valuable information and resources in a secure manner. This app will be built on existing intranet site and will be expanded with a server database as the current website uses a csv file. The app will serve as a one-stop-shop for all relevant information, including client details and industry-specific acronyms. The features include: Welcome page, Login page (Firebase Auth), Forgot password page, Account creation done by system admin, Creation of firebase for datastore and login authentication, Homepage, Acronym search, Clientâ€™s page, About us page, Settings page, Contact me section, Unisys branding and colour pallet

- **Job Check (Java)**
This project can be found on my GitHub.

- **Connection to Banking Mainframe Forms System (Java)**
This is a private project, cannot be found on GitHub. This is a program to automate filling out a form on a bank's mainframe system. The program connects to the desired form by an IP and port. Each field on the form is downloaded and the data corresponding to the field. You can edit, update, delete, add fields as you desire. Every function is hardcoded as the client wanted a basic version of the program so they can develop it in-house themself at a future date.

- **Socket Testing Bank (Java)**
This is a private project, cannot be found on GitHub. This is a program for a popular bank in Europe. The bank requested a program to stress test specific ports on their system. A message at a certain byte size had to be sent. Then the program had to wait to receive a handshake confirming the data was sent successfully. Their request was to open a connection and send multiple pieces of data. In my opinion, this doesn't represent a real environment as there would be many nodes sending requests at one time however this is what the customer wanted.

- **Instagram Automation Bot (Python)**
This project can be found on my GitHub. This is a program that has been created to automate Instagram. The idea for this program was to automate and help grow my automotive Instagram page. The program had a list of hashtags and popular users stored. There were 3 main methods, 1st was to like and comment on pictures from a hashtag, 2nd was to follow users from a specific user's account, 3rd was to follow users from specific users' recently liked photos. The program gained quite a bit of publicity on my account.

- **HeathCheck (Android & IOS) - https://health-check.uk/**
This is a private project, cannot be found on GitHub. Both of the programs on Android and IOS have been created however not available on the store. This is an application dedicated to the automotive industry mainly focusing on body shops and mechanics. The first side of the app allows a mechanic to create a full vehicle health check report, store the report internally, export the report to a personal email or a customer email. The second side of the app is aimed at a Bodyshop. A report is created based on the vehicle's body panel condition. The report allows for up to 20 images to be sorted. Just like the previous side of the app, you can internally store these reports, export them to a personal email or a client's email. This is a live program currently being used by a garage.

- **BATMan (C#)**
This is a private project, cannot be found on GitHub. This is a program that decodes a logfile from a mainframe system and creates an input file that would replicate what happened in the logfile. The input logfile is capped at a max of 10MB however you can input multiple logfiles. The program decodes character at a time as many factors come in place etc. There is a specific algorithm that decodes the log file so that it can be used as an input file to replicate the logfile. The program on average handles a 10MB file in 20 seconds. A tested collection of files with the size of 50MB has been decoded in 115 seconds. One of my most complicated log files as there were so many factors that came into play.

- **Excel-Transfer (Java)**
This project can be found on my GitHub. The program takes two Excel files 'Codebook' and 'Codeframe' as input. It then reads Codeframe and stores the keys that are stored in a hashmap. Then the program reads Codebook. Using the keys stored in the hashmap Codebook file is filled in.
